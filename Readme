# Multi Relational GNN

## Quick setup

First create a new virtual environment.

For example, using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/)

Next, please run:
```
conda create -n sentanalysis python=3.11
conda activate sentanalysis

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install jupyter
```

Open and execute `Bi_GRU_self_attention.ipynb` to run the BiGRU self attention network to extract causal phrases from review snippets*.
The second notebook, i.e., `Latent_semantic_Indexing_and_MRGNN.ipynb`, contains the code to extract phrase embeddings. Note that this second notebook requires a GPU, thus we suggest executing it on Google Colab using the embedded link in the notebook.
Each notebook could be executed independently, downloading the required dataset in each execution.
