## Quick setup

First create a new virtual environment.

For example, using [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/)

Next, please run:
```
conda create -n sentanalysis python=3.11
conda activate sentanalysis

pip install -r requirements.txt

pip install jupyter
```

Open and execute `analysis.ipynb` to run the NLP pipeline composed by *TF-ID* and *LogisticRegression*.
The second notebook, i.e., `analysis_with_embeddings.ipynb`, contains the NLP pipeline using *SentenceTransformers* to extract sentence embeddings. Note that this second notebook requires a GPU, thus we suggest executing it on Google Colab using the embedded link in the notebook.
Each notebook could be executed independently, downloading the required dataset in each execution. The script `download_dataset.py` could be used to download and store the dataset as CSV.
